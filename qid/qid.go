/*Qid represents the server's unique identification for a file.

Two files on the same server hierarchy are
the same if and only if their Qids are the same. (The
client may have multiple Fids pointing to a single file on a
server and hence having a single Qid.) The Qid fields hold a type,
specifying whether the file is a directory, append-only file, etc.,
the Qid Version and the Qid Path. The Path is an integer unique
among all files in the hierarchy.  If a file is deleted and recreated with
the same name in the same directory, the old and new path
components of the Qids should be different. The Version is
a version number for a file; typically, it is incremented
every time the file is modified.
